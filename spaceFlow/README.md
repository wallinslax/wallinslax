# spaceFlow LLC

spaceFlow is a technology-driven company with a clear mission to optimize space utilization and facilitate a seamless rental experience.

Our advanced platform offers a comprehensive solution for both landlords, including property agencies, and tenants, automating daily rent management tasks through the utilization of IoT devices such as smart locks, smart meters, and AI cameras. By addressing pain points experienced by both parties, we enhance transparency and foster a more efficient exchange of property information.

One prevalent challenge for landlords arises when tenants express interest in viewing a room in person, necessitating the physical presence of an agent and carrying the risk of potential no-shows. Our groundbreaking solution, the cloud room tour, revolutionizes this process. Landlords or agents can now remain online, awaiting tenants and virtually accompanying them during the room tour. Tenants experience a true-to-life room tour and gain access to the property independently, accompanied by online agents. The entire process is fortified by a secure live camera stream sourced from the tenant's phone, eliminating the need for additional installations, while our sophisticated malicious event detection ensures a safe environment.

Furthermore, our platform seamlessly integrates various rent-related operations, including rent payments, repair requests, contract signing, tenant/landlord credit checks, room advertising, and even legal consulting. By consolidating these essential functions into a single platform, we empower landlords and tenants alike with a centralized hub that streamlines the rental process, saving time and increasing convenience.

At spaceFlow, we are committed to revolutionizing the rental industry through cutting-edge technology and outstanding customer service. Our platform serves as a catalyst for maximizing space utilization and ensuring a seamless rent flow. Join us as we transform the way properties are managed, making space utilization more efficient and rent management an effortless experience.
